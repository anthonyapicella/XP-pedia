## Description 

User loads page, enters a userID and picks from checkboxes to help estimate their daily free time. The user then searches for a game and our application shows them a list of relevant games and the times it takes to complete each one.

Our user then selects a game and adds it to their profile banner. From there they can choose the amount of days they would like to play and the app will calculate the exact hours/minutes per day they will need to play in order to beat the game within their desired time frame.
